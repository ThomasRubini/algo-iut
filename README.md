# What ?

This projet can transpile the custom (fr*nch) programming language used at the IUT Aix-Marseille, into C++.

This project works as a CLI (available on Linux/Windows/MacOS), and as an online website available at https://thomasrubini.github.io/algo-iut

# How to build
- Install the Go language toolchain
- Run `go build` in the root of this repository
- A new binary `algo-iut` (or `algo-iut.exe` on Windows) will have been created.
